# Code Blocks

Code blocks is modular and modern native Web implementation (HTML/CSS/JS) of the code block programming interface of Scratch. It is meant to be integratable into any project that requires non-programers to code somewhat complex processes without knowing about any programming language. Code blocks is meant to be a transparent programming interface between text-based code and the user.

Supported features:
 - Bidirectionnal translation between code blocks and text via templates ;
 - Support for basic types and input restrictions ;
 - Support for functions ;
 - Support for static configuation of blocks via forms ;
 - Multilingual support.
